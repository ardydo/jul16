# ship

So, I wanted to learn some Corona SDK, android development, etc and since I needed to make a game for this month, why not both?

The game is really simple as I didn't have that much time to work on it, but I'm proud of the result even if it's not the best.

## Intructions

Just touch either side of the screen to launch the ship towards it. Try to dodge the spinning thingies falling of the sky.

## Download

Unfortunately, I can't upload it to any appstore but you can get the .apk [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/piwnyo3guhlalbp/ship.apk?dl=0). The app doesn't need any permissions at all but you still need to enable "unknown sources" in your phone security tab under the settings.
